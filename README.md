# Create an NFT using Hardhat
### This is a simple project  that teaches how to create an NFT(smart contract) using Hardhat framework to deploy and test the smart contract.
### The deployment is on the Ropsten network (Ethereum testnet)

## To run this project you need to: 
- Clone the repository 
- Run `npm install` 
- Run `npx hardhat compile` 
- Run `npx hardhat test`

### **If you want to deploy to any network you have to configure `hardhat.config` file.**

### **In my case I am using Ropsten and if you want to use the same you may follow the next steps:**

- Create a new project on Alchemy and select Ropsten network (this step is to get a privatekey) 
- An ethereum account (I am using my metamask wallet) also need the private key to add to the configs.
- Also create an account on ethereum scan and to the same as the previous steps
